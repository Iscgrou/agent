## Implementation Details

### 1. System Initialization
```javascript
const systemManager = new SystemManager(config);
await systemManager.initialize();
await systemManager.startOperation();
```

### 2. Problem Analysis
```javascript
const analysis = await systemManager.analyzeProblem(input);
const strategy = analysis.strategy;
```

### 3. Task Distribution
```javascript
const task = await systemManager.distributeAndMonitorTask(problem);
const result = await task;
```

### 4. Error Recovery
```javascript
try {
    await operation();
} catch (error) {
    await systemManager.handleSystemError(error);
}
```

## Configuration

The system is highly configurable through the `platform-settings.json` file, which includes:

- Theme customization
- Feature toggles
- Agent configurations
- Resource limits
- Integration settings
- Security policies
